# Adif_Mapper

This is my first attempt at creating a github app.  
The python program imports a .adif file downloaded from pskreporter.org and 
saved in the data folder as input.adif and then creates an interactive map as a 
dash app.  

This is a developmental beta version.  I am planning to add more functionality to the analysis.
